- 👋 Hi, I’m @DaveFS
- 👀 I’m interested in Python projects and building towards development jobs so am picking up SQL practice and wider knowledge in my job too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning working through a Flask WebDev tutorial with a plan to build a webapp once I've got the basics on board.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects to build experience.
